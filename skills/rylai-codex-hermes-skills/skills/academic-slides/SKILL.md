> Rylai Codex-Hermes Edition | Maintained and adapted by Rylai

## Runtime Compatibility

- Codex: install under `~/.agents/skills/academic-slides` and use `agents/openai.yaml` for UI metadata.
- Hermes: install under `~/.hermes/skills/academic-slides` or expose the bundle through `skills.external_dirs`.
- Resolve bundled files relative to this skill directory; do not depend on paths from another runtime.
- Map capabilities to the current runtime: Codex image generation uses `image_gen`; Hermes uses `image_generate`.
- Verify binaries, packages, credentials, network access, and tool availability before execution.

# Academic Slides

Create or improve an academic presentation and its talk narrative.

## Workflow

1. Confirm audience, setting, duration, slide count, source paper, and required output.
2. Define one main claim and an evidence sequence that fits the allotted time.
3. Build a slide outline with action titles, visual intent, and speaker purpose.
4. Use the presentation tooling available in the runtime or repository.
5. Keep methods and results legible; move secondary detail to backup slides.
6. Add rehearsal timing, likely questions, and a backup-slide plan.
7. Render and visually inspect the deck before delivery.

## Bundled Guidance

- `assets/talk-outline-template.md`: planning worksheet.
- `references/talk-structure.md`: narrative structures by talk type.
- `references/slide-design.md`: hierarchy and density rules.
- `references/slide-creation.md`: implementation and QA workflow.
- `references/delivery-and-qa.md`: rehearsal, timing, and Q&A preparation.

## Quality Bar

- Titles should state takeaways rather than topic labels.
- Avoid dense paper paragraphs, tiny figures, and unsupported decorative visuals.
- Never claim a slide or deck was rendered when only an outline was produced.
