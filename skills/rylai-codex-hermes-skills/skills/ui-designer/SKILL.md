## Runtime Compatibility

- Codex: install under `~/.agents/skills/ui-designer` and use `agents/openai.yaml` for UI metadata.
- Hermes: install under `~/.hermes/skills/ui-designer` or expose the bundle through `skills.external_dirs`.
- Resolve bundled files relative to this skill directory; do not depend on paths from another runtime.
- Map capabilities to the current runtime: Codex image generation uses `image_gen`; Hermes uses `image_generate`.
- Verify binaries, packages, credentials, network access, and tool availability before execution.

# Portable UI Designer

Extract an implementation-ready design system from supplied screenshots or mockups.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the original image at sufficient resolution.
2. Identify layout grid, spacing rhythm, typography, color roles, radii, borders, shadows, icon style, and component states.
3. Separate observed properties from inferred behavior.
4. Compare the extracted system with the target repository's existing framework and design tokens.
5. Produce a concise implementation specification covering components, responsive behavior, assets, and interaction states.
6. Implement only when requested, then verify the result against the reference at desktop and mobile sizes.

## Bundled Templates

- `assets/design-system.md`: evidence-based visual-system extraction.
- `assets/app-overview-generator.md`: concise product and workflow brief.
- `assets/vibe-design-template.md`: implementation handoff prompt.

## Boundaries

- Do not invent hidden screens, states, fonts, or assets without labeling them as assumptions.
- Prefer the repository's installed component and icon libraries.
- Keep text and controls within stable responsive bounds.
