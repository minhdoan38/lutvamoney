> Rylai Codex-Hermes Edition | Maintained and adapted by Rylai

## Runtime Compatibility

- Codex: install under `~/.agents/skills/seo` and use `agents/openai.yaml` for UI metadata.
- Hermes: install under `~/.hermes/skills/seo` or expose the bundle through `skills.external_dirs`.
- Resolve bundled files relative to this skill directory; do not depend on paths from another runtime.
- Map capabilities to the current runtime: Codex image generation uses `image_gen`; Hermes uses `image_generate`.
- Verify binaries, packages, credentials, network access, and tool availability before execution.
- Upstream package status: `adapted-core`. The main workflow was rewritten to avoid missing legacy resources; advanced upstream features may remain unavailable.

# Portable SEO Audi

Audit the exact website or page using evidence available to the current runtime.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the target URL, market, language, business type, and audit scope.
2. Fetch or browse the live page and inspect rendered content, HTML, metadata, links, and indexability signals.
3. Review technical basics: status codes, canonicals, robots directives, sitemap exposure, headings, structured data, mobile behavior, and performance evidence.
4. Review search intent, page usefulness, internal linking, duplication, and content gaps.
5. Separate observed defects from recommendations that need Search Console, analytics, backlink, or crawl data.
6. Prioritize findings by impact, confidence, effort, and affected routes.
7. Re-check current search-engine documentation before asserting time-sensitive rules.

## Boundaries

- Do not claim a full crawl, Search Console result, Core Web Vitals measurement, or backlink audit without the relevant data.
- Do not invent rankings, traffic, index status, or competitor metrics.
- Prefer narrow implementation fixes tied to evidence.
