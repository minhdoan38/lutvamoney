# Image Analyzer

Analyze the supplied image itself before making claims.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the exact local file, attachment, or user-approved URL.
2. Inspect the original resolution when small text, fine detail, or cropping matters.
3. Match the analysis to the request: description, OCR, layout, objects, comparison, or extraction.
4. Separate direct observations from interpretation and uncertainty.
5. Preserve reading order for OCR and mark unreadable regions instead of guessing.
6. For structured extraction, define the schema first and use `null` for unavailable fields.
7. When comparing images, use the same checklist for every image.
8. Return concise evidence and note any resolution or visibility limits.

## Runtime Routes

- Codex: use the available image viewer or native vision capability.
- Hermes: use its configured vision tool.
- Use an external OCR or vision service only when the user approves it and the
  required credentials are already configured.

## Safety

- Do not infer sensitive identity, health, ethnicity, or exact location withou
  reliable evidence and a legitimate user request.
- Do not claim that an object, logo, person, or place is certain when the image
  only supports a tentative match.
- Never upload a private image to an external service without user approval.
